# Search and Sort Findings

Data structures simply arrange data in a computer's memory in a certain way

# General Notes
- when testing, times varied each time it was run, but still followed the same order

- binary search is a lot lot faster when compared to linear search, but this requires the array to be sorted

- its hard to compare these searching algorithms as they are fundamentally different

- bubble sort took the longest as it performs a lot of 'swaps' and cannot finish early

- selection sort was 2nd fastest behind insertion sort as insertion sort can finish early
