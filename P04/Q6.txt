Describe 3 errors and describe why each is a problem

1: 
    ERROR: lines 1 and 15 are redundant
    DESCRIPTION: found (booelean)  is set to TRUE twice
    REASONING: because found is initialised as true, writing the expression again is an area
               of redundancy, additionally the boolean is not used at any point in this piece of code and serves no purpose

2:
    ERROR: line 16 does not align with coding standards
    DESCRIPTION: According to the standards in this course, a break in any other place than a switch statement will be penalised
    REASONING: a break automatically exits the code and ignores the control structure it is in

3:
    ERROR: line 11 could be re-written in a different way
    DESCRIPTION: numElements is used to describe the depth of the search, this should instead be written as the LENGHT OF the array
    REASONING: the number of elements is not always the same as the count of elements in the array
